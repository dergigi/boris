# Basic Emphasis Test

This file tests bold and italic text formatting using asterisks and underscores.

## Bold Text

Bold text is created using two asterisks or two underscores before and after the text.

I just love **bold text**.

I also love __bold text with underscores__.

**Bold text** can appear at the start of a sentence.

A sentence can end with **bold text**.

A sentence can have **bold text** in the middle.

## Italic Text

Italic text is created using one asterisk or one underscore before and after the text.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

Italicized text is also the _cat's meow_.

*Italic text* can appear at the start of a sentence.

A sentence can end with *italic text*.

A sentence can have *italic text* in the middle.

## Bold and Italic Together

To emphasize text with both bold and italics, use three asterisks or three underscores.

This text is ***bold and italic***.

This text is also ___bold and italic___.

***Bold and italic*** can appear at the start of a sentence.

A sentence can end with ***bold and italic***.

A sentence can have ***bold and italic*** in the middle.

## Mid-Word Emphasis

You can emphasize the middle of a word for emphasis.

Love**is**bold

Love*is*italic

Love***is***bolditalic

## Best Practices

### Use Asterisks for Mid-Word Emphasis

For compatibility, use asterisks when emphasizing the middle of a word.

Love**is**bold (correct)

Love__is__bold (may not work in all processors)

A*cat*meow (correct)

A_cat_meow (may not work in all processors)

### Spacing Around Emphasis

Emphasis markers should be directly adjacent to the text being emphasized.

This is **correct** spacing.

This is ** incorrect ** spacing.

This is *correct* spacing.

This is * incorrect * spacing.

## Multiple Emphasis in One Paragraph

A single paragraph can contain multiple instances of bold, italic, and combined emphasis.

This paragraph has **bold text**, *italic text*, and ***bold italic text*** all together. You can use **multiple bold** sections and *multiple italic* sections in the same paragraph.

## Emphasis with Punctuation

Emphasis works correctly with adjacent punctuation marks.

**Bold text**, with a comma.

**Bold text.** With a period.

**Bold text!** With an exclamation.

**Bold text?** With a question mark.

*Italic text*, with a comma.

*Italic text.* With a period.

*Italic text!* With an exclamation.

*Italic text?* With a question mark.

## Emphasis at Word Boundaries

Emphasis can appear at the start or end of words.

**Start** of a word.

End of a **word**.

*Start* of a word.

End of a *word*.

## Emphasis with Links

Emphasis can be combined with links.

This is a [**bold link**](https://example.com).

This is a [*italic link*](https://example.com).

This is a [***bold italic link***](https://example.com).

## Emphasis with Code

Emphasis cannot be used inside code blocks, but can appear alongside inline code.

This has `code` and **bold** together.

This has `code` and *italic* together.

## Nested Emphasis

You cannot nest emphasis of the same type, but you can combine different types.

***Bold and italic*** is valid.

**Bold with *italic inside* bold** is valid.

*Italic with **bold inside** italic* is valid.

## Edge Cases

### Emphasis with Only Spaces

**   **

*   *

### Emphasis with Special Characters

**Bold with !@#$%**

*Italic with !@#$%*

### Very Short Emphasis

****

***

**

*

### Emphasis Markers Without Closing

**Bold text without closing

*Italic text without closing

### Emphasis with Numbers

**123**

*456*

### Emphasis with Only Punctuation

**!!!**

*???*
