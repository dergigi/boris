# Boris

Your reading list for the Nostr world.

Boris turns your Nostr bookmarks into a calm, fast, and focused reading experience. Connect your Nostr account and you’ll get a clean three‑pane reader: bookmarks on the left, the article in the middle, and highlights on the right.

## What Boris does

- Collects your saved links from Nostr and shows them as a tidy reading list
- Opens articles in a distraction‑free reader with clear typography
- Shows community highlights layered on the article (yours, friends, everyone)
- Lets you collapse sidebars anytime for full‑focus reading
- Remembers simple preferences like view mode, fonts, and highlight style

## How it works

1. Connect your Nostr account.
   - Click “Connect” and approve with your usual Nostr signer.
2. Browse your bookmarks.
   - Your lists and items appear on the left. Pick anything to read.
3. Read in comfort.
   - The center panel renders a readable article view with images and headings.
4. See what people highlighted.
   - The right panel shows highlights by level:
     - Mine (your highlights)
     - Friends (people you follow)
     - Nostrverse (everyone else)
   - Each level has its own color. Click any highlight to jump to that spot.
5. Focus when you want.
   - Collapse one or both side panels. The layout adapts without wasting space.

## Why people like Boris

- No noise: Just your saved links and the best excerpts others found
- Fast by default: Opens instantly in your browser
- Portable: Works with any Nostr account; your data travels with you
- Designed for reading: Smooth navigation and instant scroll‑to‑highlight

## Tips

- Hover icons and counters to see what they do — most controls are discoverable.
- Lots of highlights? Scan the right panel and click to jump between them.
- Open Settings to switch fonts, tweak highlight styles, and change the list view.

## Privacy and data

- Boris doesn’t ask for an email or create a new account — it connects to your existing Nostr identity.
- Your bookmarks and highlights live on Nostr. Boris reads from the network and renders everything locally in your browser.

## Troubleshooting

- If something looks empty, try opening another article and coming back — network data can arrive in bursts.
- Not every article has highlights yet; they grow as the community reads.
