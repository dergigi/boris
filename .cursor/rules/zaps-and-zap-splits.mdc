description: Specification for zaps and zaps splits
alwaysApply: false

When we create highlights, we want to add `zap` tags to the event, to allow for value splits between the highlighter/curator and the author (or authors).

`zap` tags are defined in Appendix G of NIP-57:
- https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md

More on `zap` tags here:
- https://nostrbook.dev/tags/zap

Note that nostr-native content might have `zap` tags already, which can be seen as the "author group" of e.g. the long-form article (writer, editor, designer, etc). We should respect these `zap` tags and include them into our "zap splits" appropriately.

Example: if our zap-split setting is 50/50, and the nostr-native blog post has two authors, our zap splits should be as follows:

- Highlighter: 50%
- Author1: 25%
- Author2: 25%
