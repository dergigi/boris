Read the nostrbook to understand how bookmarks work:
- https://nostrbook.dev/kinds/10003
- https://nostrbook.dev/kinds/30003

They are defined in NIP-51:
- https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/51.md

Also refer to the applesauce bookmark helpers:
- https://github.com/hzrd149/applesauce/blob/17c9dbb0f2c263e2ebd01729ea2fa138eca12bd1/packages/core/src/helpers/bookmarks.ts

Make sure to always use applesauce, and use it properly.
